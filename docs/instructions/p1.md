# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a user-friendly online store written in python for the backend developement and flask for the framework.
Our platform allows customers to easily browse, select, and purchase a diverse range of fresh and organic fruits and vegetables providing an easy shopping experience.
## Requirements



Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A short description of the requirement. This should be a single sentence that describes the requirement. Do not replace the word `Description` with the actual description. Put the description in the space where these instructions are written. Maintain that practice for all future sections.
  - **Type:** The type of requirement. Should be either `Functional` or `Non-Functional`.
  - **Priority:** The priority of the requirement. This should be a number between 1 and 5, with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being the lowest priority.
  - **Rationale:** A short description of why the requirement is important. This should be a single sentence that describes why the requirement is important.
  - **Testing:** A short description of how the requirement can be tested. This should be a single sentence that describes how the requirement can be tested.
- **ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A short description of the requirement. This should be a single sentence that describes the requirement.
  - **Type:** The type of requirement. Should be either `Functional` or `Non-Functional`.
  - **Priority:** The priority of the requirement. This should be a number between 1 and 5, with 1 being the highest priority and 5 being the lowest priority.
  - **Rationale:** A short description of why the requirement is important. This should be a single sentence that describes why the requirement is important.
  - **Testing:** A short description of how the requirement can be tested. This should be a single sentence that describes how the requirement can be tested.
**ID** REQ-1
**Description** The store logo is to be displayed accross the website
**Type** Non-Functional
**Priority** 4
**Rationale** To provide identity to the website and help customers recognize the brand
**Testing** This feature is to be tested manually when opening the website
**ID** REQ-2
**Description** The website allows the customer to select a quantity of a product
**Type** Functional
**Priority** 1
**Rationale** A customer wants a specific quantity of each product
**Testing**In the cart section, the quantity of each product selected must be reflected
**ID** REQ-3
**Description**The system will section each product category for the user to identify between fruits, vegetables, seeds, and other groceries products.
**Type** Functional
**Priotity** 2
**Rationale** This features helps the user navigate throught different product categories to help them find what they need easily.
**Testing** Using the category buttons to navigate the website veryfying that each product is in its correct category/section.


## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

**Constraint 1** Mobile responsiveness, we have to ensure that the website is optimized for mobile use, displaying accurately accross different screen sizes, providing the same performance as its desktop counterpart.
**Constraint 2** Interface design, using a three color pallette for the website design.

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:
**ID** UC-1
**Description** The customer navigates through the different product categories to find the specific products that they want
**Actors** Customer, Online grocery store
**Preconditions**  The customer has in mind what type of product they want to browse from the virtual store.
				   The online grocery stores has sections for each type of product (Vegetables, Fruits, Seeds)
**Postconditions** The customer finds the desired products from the online store.
				   The system diplayed the correct contents according to the prodct category.
**ID** UC-2
**Description** The customer places and order for delivery
**Actors** Customer, Online grocery store
**Preconditions**  The customer has logged into their personal account
				   The customer has its address information linked to their personal account
**Postconditions** The customer receives an order confirmation
				   The system stores the order information

				   
					

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the use case. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like UC-1, UC-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Description:** A description of the use case that gives the user a high-level overview of how the system is interacted with.
  - **Actors:** A list of the actors that are involved in the use case. Only include the actors that are directly involved. Actors are the people or things that interact with the system. For example, when ordering at a fast food restaurant, one might have the following actors: the customer, the cashier, and the cook. But only the customer and the cashier are directly involved in the use case of ordering food. The cook is not directly involved in the use case of ordering food.
  - **Preconditions:** A list of the preconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the preconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met before the use case can be executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have money in their wallet and the cashier must be logged in to the system before the use case of ordering food can be executed.
  - **Postconditions:** A list of the postconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the postconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met after the use case has been executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have their food and the cashier must have the customer's money after the use case of ordering food has been executed.

## User Stories

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** A unique identifier for the user story. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like US-1, US-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  - **Type of User:** The type of user that the user story is for. This should be a single word that describes the type of user. For example, a user story for a customer might be `Customer` and a user story for an administrator might be `Admin`.
  - **Description:** A description of the user story that gives a narrative from that user's perspective. This can be any length, but it must paint the picture of what the user wants to do, how they intend to do it, why they want to, and what they expect to happen.
	 
**ID** US-1
**Type of User:** Customer
**Description:** As I'm looking to buy tomato seeds for my harvest, I navigate through the product sections, after finsing the "Seeds" category, I click on it I expect to see the different types of seeds and choose one according to my specific needs.  
**ID** US-2
**Type of User:** Administrator
**Description:** As I check to fulfill ongoing delivery orders and log in with the Administrator credentials, I can check the orders processed througout the day and I expect to see them sorted by priority order.

## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:


- **Term:** The term that is being defined. This should be a single word or phrase that is being defined.
  - **Definition:** A definition of the term. This should be a short description of the term that is being defined. This should be a single sentence that describes the term.

Try to only list terms that a naive user would not understand.
